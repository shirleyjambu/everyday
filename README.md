Everyday

This project is a web application which can be used to track daily expenses, to-do activities and schedule appointments and reminders using voice/text input. The app uses a NLP parser to parse the user input and do the appropriate action.

For example, if the user input is "Pay bills by April 15th", a reminder is added to the calendar for April 15th. If the input is "Tickets for $100" or "Paid $50 for Groceries", the amount and category is saved under Expenses section. If the input is "Buy Vegetables" then it is saved and listed under the Shopping List section.

The app is modularized and can be enhanced and extended in scope to add more features.It is built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Bulma, CSS & SASS.
